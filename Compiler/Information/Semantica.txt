Numeric constants without a decimal point are of of type int. Otherwise they are of type float.
When at least one of the operands of an arithmetic binary operator (plus, minus...) is of type ‬
float then the result of the operator is of type float otherwise (that is, the two operands are
of type int) the result is of type int.

When a binary operator is applied to operands of different types, one int
and the other float, then the operand of type int is converted to float
before activating the operator.

Each variable must be defined once.

Dividing two integers gives their whole quotient.

The conversion operation is valid when its two sides are of the same type or the left side is a float.
In the case of converting an int type value into a float type variable, the value is converted to float.

The break statement can only appear inside a while loop or inside a switch. Its meaning
is the same as in the C language. In the absence of break in the code for case (in the switch statement) then after executing the code
for that case, we continue and execute the code for the next case (as in the C language).

The expression that appears after switch must be of type int. So is any number that appears ‬
after case.

The meaning of static_cast is similar to the meaning in the C++ language.
